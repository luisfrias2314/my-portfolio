      <h1>Luis Frias Portfolio</h1>
      <p>  Hi, I am Luis! I am a first generation second year Computer Science Major at the University of California, Los Angeles. 
           I grew a fascination of technology when I started playing video games at a young age. I was in awe of the characters and features.
           I did not understand how this technology worked at the time, but I knew I wanted to explore this area of study. 
           I eventually got to high school and took courses where I gauged my specific interest in computer science through courses. 
           I decided I wanted to pursue a degree in this field at the university level where I currently stand. </p>
         <p> 
        
            I have since taken numerous courses that have strengthened my programming skills in C++, HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT. 
            I have completed numerous projects from informationâ€™s websites, logistic systems, to video games. However,
            I want to base my career around helping my community.
            I want to use the skills that I develop in technology and share them individuals who might not get a chance to explore computer science like me. </p>
