       <h1>Luis Frias Portfolio</h1>
       <p>  Hi, I am Luis! I am a first generation second year Computer Science Major at the University of California, Los Angeles. 
            I grew a fascination of technology when I started playing video games at a young age. I was in awe of the characters and features.
            I did not understand how this technology worked at the time, but I knew I wanted to explore this area of study. 
            I eventually got to high school and took courses where I gauged my specific interest in computer science through courses. 
            I decided I wanted to pursue a degree in this field at the university level where I currently stand. </p>
          <p> 

             I have since taken numerous courses that have strengthened my programming skills in C++, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 
             I have completed numerous projects from informationâ€™s websites, logistic systems, to video games. However,
             I want to base my career around helping my community.
             I want to use the skills that I develop in technology and share them individuals who might not get a chance to explore computer science like me. </p>
